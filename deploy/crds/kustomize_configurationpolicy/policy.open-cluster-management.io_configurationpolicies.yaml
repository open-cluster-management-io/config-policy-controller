          ConfigurationPolicy is the schema for the configurationpolicies API. A configuration policy
          contains, in whole or in part, an object definition to compare with objects on the cluster. If
          the definition of the configuration policy doesn't match the objects on the cluster, a
          noncompliant status is displayed. Furthermore, if the RemediationAction is set to `enforce` and
          the name of the object is available, the configuration policy controller creates or updates the
          object to match in order to make the configuration policy compliant.
