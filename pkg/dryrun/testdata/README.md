# About these tests

The test cases in `pkg/dryrun/testdata/` are meant to exercise the dryrun tool,
and verify it behaves correctly with different kinds of inputs and that the
output format is correct. These tests are not necessarily meant to check that
ConfigruationPolicies are working as intended.
